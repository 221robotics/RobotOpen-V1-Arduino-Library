Packet format (14 bytes):

[0] = 0xFF (header byte 1)
[1] = 0x00 (header byte 2)
[2] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 1)
[3] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 2)
[4] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 3)
[5] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 4)
[6] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 5)
[7] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 6)
[8] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 7)
[9] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 8)
[10] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 9)
[11] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (PWM channel 10)
[12] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (CRC-16 High Byte)
[13] = Value from 0x00 to 0xFF (CRC-16 Low Byte)

CRC-16 is generated from first 12 bytes. Baud rate: 115200. PWMs are disconnected after 250ms without a valid packet. PWMs are generated on Arduino pins 2-11.
